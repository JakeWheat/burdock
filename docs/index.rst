Burdock
#######

Programming language design and implementation learning project. Takes
a lot of inspiration from `Pyret <https://www.pyret.org/>`_,
particularly the syntax. Implemented in Haskell.

This page will become the website. See the readme: https://github.com/JakeWheat/burdock/blob/main/README

A demo of the document testing feature, which is also called 'literate mode', the code in an .rst document can be run using literate mode for the Interpreter (which parses code in code-blocks and skips the rest of the document), and the .rsts for the website are added to the automated tests for the system.

.. code-block:: burdock

  check:
    1 + 2 is 3
  end
