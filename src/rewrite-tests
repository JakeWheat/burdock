# dsl for testing the rewriter
# decided that it was simplest to test the rewriter by creating a number
# of files, then checking the final file rewrites to a particular syntax
# or gives some particular errors

##############################################################################

# check the absolute basics without modules

# these are things that the renamer should pass through without
# changing or producing errors
